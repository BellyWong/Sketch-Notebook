# Sketch Notebook

Easily manage sidebar comments for documenting design.

## Installation

Download the plugin, unzip the archive, and place the folder contents in your Sketch Plugins folder by navigating to Sketch > Plugins > Reveal Plugins Folder…

It should look like this:

![Toggle comments visibility](assets/readme_images/sketchfolder.png?raw=true "Toggle comments visibility")

Now you can use the plugin from the "Plugins" menu:

![Plugins menu](assets/readme_images/pluginmenu.png?raw=true "Plugins menu")

## Using the plugin

**Remember:** this initial release requires to have a page in your document called "--nb--assets" where all assets are stored (this won't be needed on the next update). There is a template included in this plugin, placed in the "assets" folder.

### Add Comment `ctrl` + `alt` + `⌘` + `9`
Select any layer of your document and run this command, then you'll be asked to type the comment title and detail. That's it.

### Realign comments `ctrl` + `alt` + `⌘` + `8`
Run this command anytime to update the sidebar. Here is a list of things that you can do:

#### Reorder comments
Put the comments in the order you want and then run the "realign comments" command. They will automatically reorder and renumber.

#### Edit comment content
Just edit them as normal layers and then run "realign comments"

![Edit comment](assets/readme_images/edit_comment.gif?raw=true "Edit comment")

#### Delete comment
1. Select the layout group that contains the comment you want to remove,
2. delete it and then,
3. run "realign comments". 
Again, all comments will be automatically reordered and renumbered.

### Toggle Sidebar Visibility `ctrl` + `alt` + `⌘` + `0`
This command is pretty self-explanatory... toggle the visibility of the sidebar by running it.
