## Using the plugin

**Remember:** this initial release requires to have a page in your document called "--nb--assets" where all assets are stored (this won't be needed on the next update). There is a template included in this plugin, placed in the "assets" folder.

### Toggle comments visibility `ctrl` + `alt` + `⌘` + `0`
This command is pretty self-explanatory... toggle the visibility of the sidebar by running it.

### Add Comment `ctrl` + `alt` + `⌘` + `9`
Select any layer of your document and run this action, then you'll be asked to type the comment title and detail. That's it.

### Align comments `ctrl` + `alt` + `⌘` + `8`
Run this action anytime to realign or update the comments on the sidebar. Here is a list of things that you can do:

#### Reorder comments
Put the comments in the order you want and then run the "align comments" command. They will automatically reorder and renumber.

#### Edit comment content
Just edit them as normal layers and then run "align comments"

#### Delete comment
Select the layout group that contains the comment you want to delete. Hit "delete" and the run "align comments". Again, all comments will be automatically reordered and renumbered.

### Customizing the sidebar
